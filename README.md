# FPS Raid Test
 Unity practice for an FPS with focus on "Raid Mechanics". Experimenting with interactable objects in the world that allow the player to progress through levels. These objects have different abilites/requirements that the player must learn and put together in order to accomplish the objective of each room. Not really a raid since it's one person but it's the only name I could think of.
